# Python 3.x

The Python example code is located in [our git repository](https://github.com/SpotterRF/json-examples/tree/master/python3/).

Like most languages, Python comes with a JSON (de)serializer (aka parser)
as part of the standard library.

Unlike many languages, however, the JSON parser in the standard library is GOOD.

# Did you Know?

Python syntax for `dict`, `list`, `str`, and `int` literals **is** JSON?

## Compile and Run the example code

Get the Code

    git clone git://github.com/SpotterRF/json-examples.git
    cd ./json/examples/python3

Compile and run with optimizations

    python -OO ./spotterrf-example.py

**NOTE**: On older systems `python` may refer to `python2.7` instead of `python3.3` so you might need to use `python3` or `python3.3` to invoke the app.
