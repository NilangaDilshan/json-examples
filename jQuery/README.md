### jQuery

Open `index.html` in a browser.

The various examples will run and print their output on the page as well as in the console.

  * `index.jade` is the source that compiles to `index.html`.
  * `http-get.js` has a very basic [`$.get`](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/) example.
  * `http-post.js` has a more complete [`$.ajax`](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/) example.
